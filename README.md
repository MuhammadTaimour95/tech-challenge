As Asked in the instruction to spend a maximum of 4 hours on this so I had to stop working after 4 hours.

The icon is missing, the animation effect on answer is missing.

Proud of the fact that I wrote all the css myself without much help online.

I would like to improve it by adding some hovering effects.

Tried to stick on the requirements as much as possible.
